# Warning
This bot is in the alpha stage of development. I strongly urge you to reconsider your life choices if you plan to use this bot on a Discord server you care about.

# Setup:
1. Invite the bot to your server https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=809975422640717845&permissions=0&scope=bot
2. Give it admin permissions. 
3. Create a new `tickets` channel category.
4. Remove `@everyone`'s viewing permissions from `tickets`.
5. Give your support team permission to the category.
6. Set the category with `-setcategory`.
7. Use the `-panel` command wherever you want the panel to be.
8. (Optional) Create a transcript channel with `-setlog`.
